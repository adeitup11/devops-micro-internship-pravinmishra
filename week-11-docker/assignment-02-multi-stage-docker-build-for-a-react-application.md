# Assignment 2 — Multi-Stage Docker Build for a React Application

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build both a single-stage and an optimized multi-stage Docker image for a React application, compare the resulting image sizes, and deploy the optimized version using a production-ready Nginx runtime container.

---

# Task 1 — Prepare the Project

## Goal

Clone `https://github.com/pravinmishraaws/my-react-app.git` and create a `.dockerignore` excluding `node_modules`, `build`, and `.env`.

### Evidence

# Task 2 — Create a Single-Stage Docker Image

## Goal

Create `Dockerfile.single`, build `react-single`, and run it on port 3000.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Contents of `Dockerfile.single`

# Task 3 — Create a Multi-Stage Docker Build

## Goal

Create a multi-stage Dockerfile with separate build and Nginx runtime stages, build `react-multistage`, and run it on port 80.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Contents of the multi-stage Dockerfile

# Task 4 — Compare Docker Image Sizes

## Goal

Compare the single-stage and multi-stage image sizes and calculate the percentage reduction.

# Task 5 — Analyze the Optimization Results

## Goal

Write a 5–8 line analysis covering the percentage reduction, security benefits, reduced attack surface, faster distribution, and one build-caching optimization used.

### Notes

### Analysis: Single-Stage vs. Multi-Stage Docker Build

1. The single-stage Docker image size was **844.74 MB**, while the multi-stage image size was **90.61 MB**.
2. The multi-stage build reduced the image size by **89.27%**, saving approximately **754.13 MB**.
3. The multi-stage build improves security by excluding Node.js, source code, and development dependencies from the final Nginx runtime image.
4. The smaller image can reduce image-pull times, storage requirements, and deployment time.
5. The single-stage image includes build tools and dependencies that are unnecessary for serving the finished React application.
6. Both Dockerfiles use `COPY package*.json ./` before copying the application source, allowing Docker to reuse the dependency-installation cache when package files remain unchanged.
7. Overall, the multi-stage build is more efficient for production because it provides a smaller runtime image with a reduced attack surface.

# Task 6 — Explore Additional Production Optimizations (Optional)

## Goal

Optionally configure an Nginx health check, cache headers, parameterized ports via environment variables, or a lighter runtime image, and compare results.

# LinkedIn Post (Optional)

## Goal

Create a LinkedIn post describing what you built, what a multi-stage Docker build is, the image size reduction achieved, and key learnings.
